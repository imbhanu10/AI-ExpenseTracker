# AI Expense Tracker - Development Journey

## Project Overview
- **Project Name**: AI-Powered Expense Tracker
- **Initial Date**: October 4, 2025
- **Objective**: Create a Streamlit-based web application that uses Google's Gemini AI to track and categorize expenses from natural language input.

## Development Timeline

### Phase 1: Initial Setup (October 4, 2025)
1. **Project Initialization**
   - Created project directory: `expense-tracker-ai`
   - Set up Python virtual environment
   - Installed required packages: streamlit, google-generativeai, python-dotenv

2. **Core Functionality Implementation**
   - Implemented basic Streamlit UI with input field and expense list
   - Integrated Google Gemini API for natural language processing
   - Added session state management for expense tracking

### Phase 2: UI/UX Enhancements
1. **Initial UI Design**
   - Created a clean, card-based layout
   - Added responsive design for mobile and desktop
   - Implemented color-coded expense categories

2. **UI Refinements**
   - Changed currency from USD ($) to Indian Rupees (₹)
   - Made UI more compact by reducing padding and margins
   - Removed hyperlinks and streamlined the interface
   - Improved mobile responsiveness

### Phase 3: Category Management
1. **Initial Categories**
   - Started with 6 basic categories: Food, Travel, Rent, Utilities, Entertainment, Other

2. **Expanded Categories**
   - Expanded to 15 detailed categories based on common expense types
   - Each category assigned a distinct color for better visual distinction

3. **Final Category Set**
   - Streamlined to 10 main categories for better usability:
     1. Food & Dining
     2. Shopping
     3. Transportation
     4. Housing
     5. Bills & Utilities
     6. Health & Wellness
     7. Entertainment
     8. Education
     9. Travel
     10. Other

### Phase 4: Error Handling & Debugging
1. **API Integration Issues**
   - **Issue**: Initial API key formatting error
     - **Solution**: Added proper error handling and API key validation
   
   - **Issue**: Model version compatibility
     - **Solution**: Updated from 'gemini-pro' to 'gemini-2.5-flash' for better performance

2. **UI/UX Improvements**
   - **Issue**: Inconsistent currency display
     - **Solution**: Standardized all currency displays to use Indian Rupees (₹)
   - **Issue**: Mobile responsiveness
     - **Solution**: Added responsive CSS and adjusted layout breakpoints

### Phase 5: Deployment Preparation
1. **Containerization**
   - Created Dockerfile for consistent deployment
   - Set up proper environment variable handling

2. **Documentation**
   - Created comprehensive README.md
   - Added detailed setup and deployment instructions
   - Documented all environment variables

## Technical Challenges & Solutions

### 1. Gemini API Integration
- **Challenge**: Initial difficulty in parsing API responses
- **Solution**: Implemented robust JSON parsing with error handling

### 2. Session State Management
- **Challenge**: Maintaining state between Streamlit reruns
- **Solution**: Utilized Streamlit's session state for persistent data

### 3. UI Responsiveness
- **Challenge**: Ensuring good display on all device sizes
- **Solution**: Implemented responsive CSS and mobile-first design principles

## Key Features Implemented
1. **Natural Language Processing**
   - Users can input expenses in natural language
   - AI extracts amount, description, and category

2. **Expense Management**
   - Add/remove expenses
   - Clear all expenses
   - Categorization of expenses

3. **Visual Feedback**
   - Color-coded categories
   - Responsive design
   - Clean, modern UI

## Dependencies
- Python 3.9+
- streamlit
- google-generativeai
- python-dotenv

## Future Enhancements
1. User authentication
2. Data export/import (CSV/Excel)
3. Monthly/Yearly expense reports
4. Budget tracking and alerts
5. Multi-user support

## Deployment Notes
- The application can be deployed on Hugging Face Spaces
- Requires Google API key with Gemini API access
- Environment variables must be properly configured

## Lessons Learned
1. The importance of proper error handling in AI applications
2. Benefits of containerization for deployment
3. Value of responsive design in web applications
4. Importance of clear documentation throughout development
